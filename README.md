Project 1

Lightsaber Simulator

In this project I created a program which simulates a lightsaber turning on. Since I was little, I've always been a Star Wars fan, and in some way it was my major inspiration into doing this project. The program runs with a lightsaber turned off at the left side of the graphics window. When pressing the mouse as a simulated button, the lightsaber turns into the light side of the force (Jedi). When clicked a second time, the ligthsaber turns into a dark red that really represents the dark side of the force. I find this a simple but fun program in which you can either feel the heroics of Skywalker or the mighty wrath of the Sith. This is a program that still needs work and with hopes to upgrade it in the near future.
